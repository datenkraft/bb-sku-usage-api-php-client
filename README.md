# Backbone - SKU Usage API PHP Client

## Introduction

## Local setup for development

### Prerequisities

Before you continue, make sure you have **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed. Run `docker -v` and `docker-compose -v` in the terminal, to check the installation.

### Start the docker container

To be able to start working properly, **bb-docker**, **bb-sku-usage-api-php-client**, **bb-infrastructure** and **bb-sku-usage-api** projects have to be in the same folder, which means that the local structure looks like this:

```
-some-directory/  
    -bb-docker
    -bb-sku-usage-api  
    -bb-sku-usage-api-php-client
    -bb-infrastructure
```

After that, to start the docker containers, navigate to the development folder in the **bb-docker** project and run `docker-compose up`.

If the setup was correct, you should be able to xxxxx.
